            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The idea of employing surveillance cameras to detect harassment against women on roads and promptly provide location information to law enforcement arises from the urgent necessity to combat gender-based violence and ensure the safety of women in public spaces. Harassment and assault against women in public areas are pervasive issues in many societies, causing physical and psychological harm, limiting women's freedom of movement, and perpetuating gender inequality. While the implementation of surveillance camera systems has become increasingly common in urban environments to enhance public safety and crime prevention, their potential to specifically address gender-based violence has not been fully explored. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning technologies, it is possible to develop intelligent systems that can actively detect and respond to instances of harassment, thereby creating a safer environment for women.</p>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The main goal of this project is to use surveillance cameras to make public spaces safer for women by quickly detecting and responding to instances of harassment or violence. By using advanced technology, such as facial recognition and location tracking, we aim to help law enforcement authorities intervene faster and prevent gender-based violence.</p>

            <h2>Innovative Solution</h2>
            <p>CCTV cameras detecting a crime scene and immediately transmitting a signal, along with location information, to the police. This concept builds upon the previous explanation, with added emphasis on transmitting location details to enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement response. Here is an expanded overview:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>CCTV Camera Placement and Crime Detection:</strong> CCTV cameras are strategically placed to monitor public areas, streets, or buildings for potential criminal activities. The cameras utilize features such as motion detection, facial recognition, or object tracking to identify suspicious behavior or events.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring and Event Triggering:</strong> The CCTV camera feeds are continuously monitored, either by human operators or automated systems. These systems analyze the video streams in real-time to detect potential criminal activities, triggering an alert when certain criteria are met.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Identification:</strong> In addition to detecting the crime, the CCTV camera system utilizes location-tracking technology, such as GPS or IP-based geolocation, to determine the precise location where the incident is taking place.</li>
                <li><strong>Signal Transmission:</strong> When an alert is triggered, the CCTV system immediately sends a signal to a central monitoring station or directly to the nearest police station. The signal includes relevant information such as the nature of the incident, the video footage from the camera, and most importantly, the location coordinates of the crime scene.</li>
                <li><strong>Police Response and Location-based Dispatch:</strong> Upon receiving the alert, the police assess the situation and use the location information provided by the CCTV system to determine the exact crime scene. This location-based data allows them to quickly dispatch officers to the specific area, minimizing response time.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Situational Awareness:</strong> The live video feed from the CCTV camera, combined with the location information, provides the responding officers with real-time situational awareness. They can assess the situation remotely, gather additional information, and make more informed decisions about their response.</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="tech-stack">
            <h2>Technological Stack</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>CCTV Cameras:</strong> High-quality cameras equipped with advanced features such as motion detection, facial recognition, object tracking, and potentially geolocation capabilities. These cameras capture the video footage of the monitored area.</li>
                <li><strong>Video Analytics:</strong> Software or algorithms that analyze the video feed from the CCTV cameras in real-time. These analytics systems can detect suspicious activities or events based on predefined criteria, triggering an alert when a potential crime is detected.</li>
                <li><strong>Signal Transmission:</strong> Depending on the infrastructure and requirements, the CCTV system can use various communication methods to transmit the alert and location information to the police.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wired Connectivity: Ethernet or fiber-optic cables to connect the cameras and the monitoring station or police headquarters.</li>
                        <li>Wireless Connectivity: Wi-Fi, cellular networks, or specialized wireless protocols to transmit the alerts and data over the air.</li>
                        <li>Internet Protocol (IP) Networking: Utilizing IP-based communication protocols for transmitting data over the internet or private networks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Central Monitoring Station/Command Center:</strong> A control center where the CCTV feeds are monitored by human operators or automated systems. This station serves as the hub for receiving alerts and managing the response process.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Services:</strong> To determine the precise location of the crime scene, the CCTV system can utilize location services such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>GPS (Global Positioning System): Cameras equipped with GPS modules can provide accurate coordinates of their position.</li>
                        <li>IP-based Geolocation: Using IP addresses and databases to approximate the location based on the camera's network connection.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Police Systems:</strong> The CCTV system needs to integrate with the police infrastructure to transmit the alert and location information effectively.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) Systems: The CCTV system can interface with CAD systems used by the police to receive and manage emergency calls and incidents.</li>
                        <li>Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Integrating with GIS platforms allows for mapping and visualization of crime locations and optimal route planning for police dispatch.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Storage and Management:</strong> The CCTV system requires storage infrastructure to store the captured video footage for review and potential evidence. This can involve on-site or cloud-based storage solutions, depending on the scale and requirements of the system.</li>
